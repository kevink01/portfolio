# Welcome to Kevin's Portfolio

## My name is Kevin Kulich, and I'm a 4th year computer science student.

Programming has been a hobby of mine. From learning to new technologies to creating hobby projects, I have developed many skills that advances my knowledge. I always love to learn a new technology, a new technique, or a new programming paradigm.

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/studio).
